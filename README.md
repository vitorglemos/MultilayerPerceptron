Using an artificial neural network for classification

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) or connectionist systems are computing systems inspired by 
the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems learn (progressively improve performance) 
to do tasks by considering examples, generally without task-specific programming. For example, in image recognition, 
"they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as 
"cat" or "no cat" and using the analytic results to identify cats in other images".

They have found most use in applications difficult to express in a traditional computer algorithm using rule-based programming. 
An ANN is based on a collection of connected units called artificial neurons, (analogous to axons in a biological brain). 
Each connection (synapse) between neurons can transmit a signal to another neuron. The receiving (postsynaptic) neuron can 
process the signal(s) and then signal downstream neurons connected to it.
